# PACS10_S1_SUB_Board

This schematic is, to the best of my ability, a complete capture of the SSUB board found on the PAC-S10 and S1. It is based on the later revision which incorporates the KOSUB board (aka the "bodge board") into the regular layout, as well as the updates made to the audio circuit, which are detailed in a service bulletin. I have included the EAGLE design files (.brd/.sch) as well for anyone that wants to take a crack at laying out the board and producing a new one, if I don't end up doing it at some point.
